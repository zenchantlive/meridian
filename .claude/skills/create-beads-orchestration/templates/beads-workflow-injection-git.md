<requirement>You MUST follow this worktree-per-task workflow for ALL implementation work.</requirement>

<on-task-start>
1. **Parse task parameters from orchestrator:**
   - BEAD_ID: Your task ID (e.g., BD-001 for standalone, BD-001.2 for epic child)
   - EPIC_ID: (epic children only) The parent epic ID (e.g., BD-001)

2. **Create worktree:**
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   WORKTREE_PATH="$REPO_ROOT/.worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}"

   mkdir -p "$REPO_ROOT/.worktrees"
   if [[ ! -d "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]]; then
     git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b bd-{BEAD_ID}
   fi

   cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
   ```

3. **Mark in progress:**
   ```bash
   bd update {BEAD_ID} --status in_progress
   ```

4. **Read bead comments for investigation context:**
   ```bash
   bd show {BEAD_ID}
   bd comments {BEAD_ID}
   ```

5. **If epic child: Read design doc:**
   ```bash
   design_path=$(bd show {EPIC_ID} --json | jq -r '.[0].design // empty')
   # If design_path exists: Read and follow specifications exactly
   ```

6. **Invoke discipline skill:**
   ```
   Skill(skill: "subagents-discipline")
   ```
</on-task-start>

<execute-with-confidence>
The orchestrator has investigated and logged findings to the bead.

**Default behavior:** Execute the fix confidently based on bead comments.

**Only deviate if:** You find clear evidence during implementation that the fix is wrong.

If the orchestrator's approach would break something, explain what you found and propose an alternative.
</execute-with-confidence>

<during-implementation>
1. Work ONLY in your worktree: `.worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}/`
2. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
3. Log progress: `bd comment {BEAD_ID} "Completed X, working on Y"`
</during-implementation>

<on-completion>
WARNING: You will be BLOCKED if you skip any step. Execute ALL in order:

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "..."
   ```

2. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin bd-{BEAD_ID}
   ```

3. **Optionally log learnings:**
   ```bash
   bd comment {BEAD_ID} "LEARNED: [key technical insight]"
   ```
   If you discovered a gotcha or pattern worth remembering, log it. Not required.

4. **Leave completion comment:**
   ```bash
   bd comment {BEAD_ID} "Completed: [summary]"
   ```

5. **Mark status:**
   ```bash
   bd update {BEAD_ID} --status inreview
   ```

6. **Return completion report:**
   ```
   BEAD {BEAD_ID} COMPLETE
   Worktree: .worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}
   Files: [names only]
   Tests: pass
   Summary: [1 sentence]
   ```

The SubagentStop hook verifies: worktree exists, no uncommitted changes, pushed to remote, bead status updated.

<banned>
- Working directly on main branch
- Implementing without BEAD_ID
- Merging your own branch (user merges via PR)
- Editing files outside your worktree
