## Mandatory: Frontend Reviews (RAMS + Web Interface Guidelines)

<CRITICAL-REQUIREMENT>
You MUST run BOTH review skills on ALL modified component files BEFORE marking the task as complete.

This is NOT optional. Before marking `inreview`:

### 1. RAMS Accessibility Review

Run on each modified component:
```
Skill(skill="rams", args="path/to/component.tsx")
```

**What RAMS Checks:**
| Category | Issues Caught |
|----------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Missing alt text, buttons without accessible names, inputs without labels |
| **Serious** | Missing focus outlines, no keyboard handlers, color-only information |
| **Moderate** | Heading hierarchy issues, positive tabIndex values |
| **Visual** | Spacing inconsistencies, contrast issues, missing states |

### 2. Web Interface Guidelines Review

Run after implementing UI:
```
Skill(skill="web-interface-guidelines")
```

**What It Checks:**
- Vercel Web Interface Guidelines compliance
- Design system consistency
- Component patterns and best practices
- Layout and spacing standards

### Workflow

```
Implement → Run tests → Run RAMS → Run web-interface-guidelines → Fix issues → Mark inreview
```

### 3. Document Results on Bead

After running both reviews, add a comment to the bead:
```bash
bd comment {BEAD_ID} "Reviews: RAMS 95/100, WIG passed. Fixed: [issues if any]"
```

This creates an audit trail and confirms you read and acted on the results.

### Completion Checklist

Before marking `inreview`, verify:
- [ ] RAMS review completed on all modified components
- [ ] Web Interface Guidelines review completed
- [ ] CRITICAL accessibility issues fixed
- [ ] Guidelines violations addressed
- [ ] Bead comment added summarizing review results

Failure to run BOTH reviews AND document results will BLOCK your completion via SubagentStop hook.
