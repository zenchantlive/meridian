# Ralph Build Mode

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` first.

## Your Task

1. Check `specs/` folder for incomplete specs
2. If no specs, check `.beads/` with `bd ready` for actionable work
3. Check `memory/active_state.md` for current status
4. Find highest priority INCOMPLETE work
5. Implement completely
6. Run tests, verify acceptance criteria
7. Commit and push
8. Output `DONE` when done

## Rules

- ONE spec/task per iteration
- Do NOT output magic phrase until truly complete
- If blocked: explain in ralph_history.txt, exit without phrase
- Follow project-specific notes in constitution
